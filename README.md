# Kazi---TestRepository1
My first Git repository on GitHub. It will have files, folders, images and other docs. 
Github seems like fun to learn. We can easily create branches from main branch and commit any change. Now I am editing one of the branches named readme-edits. Next step is to hit commit. I am going to do that.
